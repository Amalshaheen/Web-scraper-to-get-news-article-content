## Features

*TODO: Implementation pending - the following features are planned:*

- **Multi-source scraping**: Extract articles from multiple news websites
- **Content filtering**: Filter articles by date range, keywords, categories, and sources
- **Metadata extraction**: Capture article titles, authors, publication dates, and URLs
- **Content cleaning**: Remove ads, navigation elements, and extract clean article text
- **Export formats**: Save data in JSON, CSV, and plain text formats
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful scraping with configurable delays between requests
- **Duplicate detection**: Identify and handle duplicate articles across sources
- **Resume capability**: Continue interrupted scraping sessions
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-threaded scraping for improved performance

## Architecture

*TODO: Implementation pending - planned architecture:*

The scraper will be built with a modular design consisting of:

- `scraper/core.py`: Main scraping engine and coordination logic
- `scraper/extractors/`: Website-specific content extractors
- `scraper/filters.py`: Content filtering and validation
- `scraper/storage.py`: Data storage and export functionality
- `scraper/utils.py`: Helper functions and utilities
- `config/`: Configuration files and settings management

## Requirements

*TODO: Finalize dependencies - planned requirements:*

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies** (to be added to requirements.txt):
  - `requests` - HTTP requests
  - `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
  - `lxml` - XML/HTML parser
  - `newspaper3k` - Article extraction
  - `python-dateutil` - Date parsing
  - `click` - CLI interface
  - `tqdm` - Progress bars
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation (optional)

## Installation

*TODO: Update when implementation is complete*

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amalshaheen/Web-scraper-to-get-news-article-content.git
cd Web-scraper-to-get-news-article-content
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

*TODO: Update with actual commands when implementation is complete*

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Scrape articles from a single news website
python -m scraper --url "https://example-news-site.com" --output articles/

# Scrape with date range filter
python -m scraper --url "https://example-news-site.com" --start-date "2024-01-01" --end-date "2024-01-31"
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Scrape multiple sources with keyword filtering
python -m scraper --sources config/news_sources.json --keywords "technology,AI" --format json

# Set custom rate limiting and output directory
python -m scraper --url "https://example-news-site.com" --delay 2 --output-dir ./scraped_data/

# Export metadata only (no full content)
python -m scraper --url "https://example-news-site.com" --metadata-only --format csv
```

### Configuration File Usage
```bash
# Use configuration file for complex scraping jobs
python -m scraper --config config/scraping_job.yaml
```

## Configuration

*TODO: Implement configuration system*

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Rate limiting (seconds between requests)
SCRAPER_DELAY=1.5

# Default output format (json, csv, txt)
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FORMAT=json

# Maximum articles per source
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_SOURCE=1000

# User agent string
USER_AGENT="NewsScraperBot/1.0"
```

Example configuration file (`config/scraping_job.yaml`):
```yaml
sources:
  - url: "https://example-news1.com"
    category: "technology"
  - url: "https://example-news2.com"
    category: "business"

filters:
  start_date: "2024-01-01"
  end_date: "2024-12-31"
  keywords: ["AI", "machine learning", "automation"]
  min_word_count: 200

output:
  directory: "./scraped_articles"
  format: "json"
  include_metadata: true

scraping:
  delay: 2.0
  max_retries: 3
  timeout: 30
```

## Output

*TODO: Define output structure when implementation is complete*

The scraper will organize output as follows:

```
output_directory/
├── articles/
│   ├── source1/
│   │   ├── 2024-01-15_article1.txt
│   │   ├── 2024-01-16_article2.txt
│   │   └── ...
│   └── source2/
│       ├── 2024-01-15_article3.txt
│       └── ...
├── metadata/
│   ├── articles_index.json
│   ├── scraping_summary.json
│   └── failed_urls.log
└── exports/
    ├── all_articles.csv
    └── metadata_export.json
```

### Metadata Structure
Each article entry will include:
- `url`: Original article URL
- `title`: Article headline
- `author`: Article author(s)
- `published_date`: Publication timestamp
- `source`: News source domain
- `category`: Article category/section
- `word_count`: Article length
- `summary`: Brief article summary
- `scraped_at`: Timestamp when scraped

## Ethics & Disclaimer

### Responsible Scraping

This tool is designed for **ethical and responsible web scraping**. Users must:

- **Respect robots.txt** files and website terms of service
- **Implement appropriate rate limiting** to avoid overwhelming servers

### Legal Considerations

- **Check terms of service** before scraping any website
- **Respect copyright laws** in your jurisdiction
- **Obtain permission** when required by website owners
- **Use data responsibly** and in accordance with privacy regulations

### Best Practices

- Start with small-scale testing before large scraping operations
- Monitor your scraping impact and adjust accordingly
- Be transparent about your scraping activities when possible
- Consider alternative data sources (APIs) when available

**Disclaimer**: The maintainers of this project are not responsible for how users choose to use this software. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their scraping activities comply with applicable laws, terms of service, and ethical guidelines.
